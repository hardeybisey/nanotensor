can you give me three solid projects I can work on to include on my CV as a data engineer with a masters degree in data science and  interest in machine learning. I want the projects to span across these three fields

Build a Recommendation System:
A recommendation system is a classic example of a machine learning project that requires solid data engineering skills. You can use data from an online retailer or a streaming platform to build a recommendation system that suggests products or movies to users based on their previous behavior. The data engineering component of this project would involve building an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data into a database, as well as setting up a distributed computing environment to run machine learning algorithms.

Fraud Detection System:
Fraud detection is another area where machine learning and data engineering skills come together. You can use transactional data from a financial institution to build a fraud detection system that identifies suspicious activity and flags it for further investigation. The data engineering component of this project would involve building an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data into a database, as well as implementing real-time processing to detect fraud in real-time.

Predictive Maintenance System:
Predictive maintenance is a technique used to predict when equipment is likely to fail so that maintenance can be scheduled before the failure occurs. You can use sensor data from an industrial environment to build a predictive maintenance system that identifies when equipment is likely to fail. The data engineering component of this project would involve building an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data into a database, as well as implementing real-time processing to detect anomalies in the sensor data


1. Build a Recommendation System
Steps:
Identify a dataset: You can use a dataset from an online retailer or a streaming platform. There are several publicly available datasets, such as the Amazon Product Reviews dataset or the MovieLens dataset.
Preprocess the data: Clean the data and remove any duplicates, missing values or irrelevant columns. You may also need to perform feature engineering to extract meaningful features from the data.
Build an ETL pipeline: Extract, Transform, and Load the data into a database or a data warehouse. You can use tools such as Apache Airflow or AWS Glue to build your ETL pipeline.
Train a recommendation model: There are several types of recommendation models such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid models. You can use machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch to train your model.
Deploy the model: Once you have trained your model, you can deploy it using a web service or an API. You can use Flask or Django to build a web service or API.
Evaluate the model: Measure the performance of your model using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

2. Fraud Detection System
Steps:
Identify a dataset: You can use a dataset from a financial institution or a credit card company. There are several publicly available datasets, such as the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
Preprocess the data: Clean the data and remove any duplicates, missing values, or irrelevant columns. You may also need to perform feature engineering to extract meaningful features from the d
ata.
Build an ETL pipeline: Extract, Transform, and Load the data into a database or a data warehouse. You can use tools such as Apache Airflow or AWS Glue to build your ETL pipeline.
Train a fraud detection model: You can use machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks to train your fraud detection model.
Deploy the model: Once you have trained your model, you can deploy it using a web service or an API. You can use Flask or Django to build a web service or API.
Evaluate the model: Measure the performance of your model using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

3. Predictive Maintenance System:
Steps:

Collect and prepare data: This step involves collecting and preparing data for your predictive maintenance system. You can use sensor data from an industrial environment to build a predictive maintenance system that identifies when equipment is likely to fail.
Build a model: Once you have the data, you need to build a model that can predict when equipment is likely to fail. You can use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to build your predictive maintenance system.
Deploy your model: Once your model is built, you need to deploy it in a real-time processing system that can identify anomalies in the sensor data and predict when equipment is likely to fail.
Evaluate and refine your model: Finally, you need to evaluate your model's performance and refine it as necessary.
Resources:

Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
Datasets: NASA Turbofan Engine Dataset, Predictive Maintenance Dataset
Frameworks: Apache Spark, Kafka, Flask
